Please feel free to contribute ideas, bug reports, documentation, code, and anything else that comes to mind!

Running your code through [flake8][] is appreciated. Some day it would be nice to use [Black][].

Please run tests with both `python test.py` (Python 2) and `python3 test.py` (Python 3). Both versions of Python are tested at https://travis-ci.org/IQSS/metrics.dataverse.org
