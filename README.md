# metrics.dataverse.org

https://dataverse.org/metrics only shows metrics for Harvard Dataverse but our goal is to show metrics for all installations of Dataverse around the world that are interested in displaying them.

Dataverse 4.9 and higher exposes metrics via API as JSON using a Metrics API that is documented at http://guides.dataverse.org/en/4.9.2/api/metrics.html

Now that some Dataverse installations have been upgraded 4.9 and higher, we can start to use code that will be added to this repo to host a service that aggregates metrics across various Dataverse installations.
